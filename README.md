# Smart-Car-Parking-System
   The Smart Car Parking System is designed to streamline the parking experience by automating the process of vehicle identification, 
   parking slot allocation, ticket generation, and fee payment. 
   This system leverages NFC-based infrared scanners for number plate recognition, 
   automated ticket generation, and online fee deduction, 
   providing an efficient solution that reduces the workload of parking staff and enhances customer convenience.
