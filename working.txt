Workflow

1 Vehicle Entry:
Upon arrival, the car approaches the entry point equipped with NFC-based infrared scanners.
The scanner reads the vehicle's number plate and identifies the car.

2 Parking Slot Allocation:
The system generates a unique parking_slot_id for the vehicle.
The allocated slot information is sent to the driver.

3 Ticket Generation:
An auto-generated ticket is printed at the counter for the driver to collect.
The ticket contains details such as the parking slot and entry time.

4 Automatic Parking:
The driver follows guidance to park the car in the designated slot automatically.

5 Fee Deduction:
Upon exiting, the parking fees are calculated based on the duration of stay.
Fees are automatically deducted from the customer's account linked to their customer ID.

6 Exit:
The vehicle exits the parking facility once the payment is confirmed.
